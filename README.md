# Food-Nutrition-Predictor

## Motivation

Fitness apps allow users to log their calorie intake. To do this, the user has to manually type in each item of food they had and serving size for each item they had after each meal. This can be a somewhat tedious process. This was the motivation for my project. Can we automate this process? Can an app identify what a food item is, from an image? Can it determine the serving size from the image? Being a prototype, I decided to focus on the question of identifying the food item from an image.

## Data

I looked at classifying eight different food items.
